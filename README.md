# Binary-Greedy-Network
A Python implementation of the Binary Greedy Network (BGN) algorithm from the article 

[Seeking Interpretability and Explainability in Binary Activated Neural Networks](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-63787-2_1) (accepted at xAI 2024).

## How to use
Simply run the main.py file to launch the creation of a binary-activated neural network with the BGN algorithm! The launcher's arguments in main.py correspond to all of the algorithm's tunable parameters (see the launcher's docstring).
