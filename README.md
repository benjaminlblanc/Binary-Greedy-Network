# Binary-Greedy-Network
A Python 3.11.2 implementation of the Binary Greedy Network (BGN) algorithm from the article presented at xAI-2024: 

*Seeking Interpretability and Explainability in Binary Activated Neural Networks*.

## How to use
The python script BGN.py contains both the launcher and the BGN main code. The python script utils.py contains utilitaries functions. The <datasets> folder contains every relevant dataset in .csv form (see the BGN paper for citations), while the <results> folder will contain the results in separate .txt files.
